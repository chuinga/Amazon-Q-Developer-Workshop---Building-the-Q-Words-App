# Q-Words Game Context

This is a word-guessing game similar to Wordle with the following features:

- Players have 5 attempts to guess a 6-letter word
- After each guess, the game provides feedback:
  - '+': Letter is correct and in the correct position
  - '?': Letter is in the word but in the wrong position
  - 'x': Letter is not in the word
- The game uses a dictionary of valid 6-letter words
- The application follows MVC architecture pattern

When explaining code:
1. Relate explanations to how they support the game mechanics
2. Highlight connections between components
3. Use simple language that a junior developer would understand
